            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm a full-stack MERN developer who crafts engaging web experiences, diving deep into frameworks like Next.js and Gatsby for React, and exploring back-end powerhouses like Nest.js. Always on the lookout for the next big thing, I've dabbled in socket programming, state management with Redux and React Query, and styling with Bootstrap, Tailwind, and MUI.</p>

            <p>Firebase, Passport, and NextAuth? Done. Cloud storage and deployments across Netlify, Heroku, Vercel, Render, Google Cloud? No problem. My database expertise spans MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and even Prisma ORM. My project portfolio showcases this diverse skillset, and I'm always exploring more. You can check my github profile or linkedIn project section.</p>

            <p>Competitive coding? Bring it on! My data structures prowess fuels my problem-solving skills. But beyond the code, I'm a team player with strong communication and leadership abilities.</p>

            <p>Connect with me to discuss your next project, share tech insights, or just chat about the exciting future of web development!</p>
